# Screenshot Guide for Portfolio Project Images

## Image Files to Prepare
These are the image files referenced in your portfolio code that need screenshots:

1. `/public/images/projects/code.jpg` - Generic code screenshot (default fallback)
2. `/public/images/projects/flickr-clone.jpg` - Flickr clone project 
3. `/public/images/projects/javascript.jpg` - JavaScript/TypeScript projects
4. `/public/images/projects/mern.jpg` - MERN stack project
5. `/public/images/projects/portfolio.jpg` - Portfolio project (this one already has content)
6. `/public/images/projects/python.jpg` - Python projects
7. `/public/images/projects/web.jpg` - Web development projects
8. `/public/images/projects/zelp.jpg` - Zelp (Yelp clone) project

## Screenshot Recommendations

### For each project-specific screenshot (flickr-clone, zelp, portfolio):
- Capture the main interface/homepage of the application
- Include distinctive UI elements that showcase the project's purpose
- Try to include some content/data to make it look complete
- Resolution: Aim for at least 1200×800 pixels for good quality

### For technology-specific screenshots (javascript, python, mern, web):
- For JavaScript/TypeScript: Show a clean code editor with well-structured JavaScript/TypeScript code
- For Python: Display Python code in an IDE with some interesting functionality
- For MERN: Show either MongoDB data, Express routes, React components, or Node.js server code
- For web: Show a responsive web design or HTML/CSS code

### For the generic code screenshot:
- Show clean, well-formatted code in any language
- Use a dark theme code editor for better contrast
- Include some interesting code patterns (not just basic syntax)

## Image Format Tips
- Use .jpg format as referenced in the code (or .png if you prefer higher quality)
- Maintain aspect ratio appropriate for the project cards
- Aim for images around 1-2MB in size for web performance
- Consider using consistent dimensions for all screenshots (e.g., 1200×800)

After taking screenshots, save them with the exact filenames listed above in the `/public/images/projects/` directory.
